# shopify_gulp-starter-theme
This is a quick project skeleton that I threw together using Shopify's Timber theme and a Gulp workflow to speed up development.

For now, all you need to know to make it run are these commands
```
gulp
theme watch
```

I'll add more to the README later if anyone else decides that they want to use this and needs pointers.
